                <p>Ask students to select one of the following fractions: <abbr title="four tenths">4&frasl;10</abbr> or <abbr title="two fifths">2&frasl;5</abbr>, and represent it in at least three different ways. Pairs display all of their representations in their workspace.</p>

                <p>Students circulate around the room and review the different representations. Students consider which representation they think most clearly shows the fraction, and indicate their preference by placing a sticky note with their name by their first choice. Ask students to be prepared to discuss any similarities or differences they notice between the representations of <abbr title="four tenths">4&frasl;10</abbr> and <abbr title="two fifths">2&frasl;5</abbr>.</p>
                <p>Scaffold by suggesting different manipulatives for different pairs.</p>
                <p>Students may notice that the two fractions are equivalent. Allow them to reason and explore to reach this conclusion.</p>

                <p>Guide the class to organize and name the different types of representations students preferred. Ask students who put their name on a sticky note by each particular representation to explain why they think that one is the most effective. Use prompts such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What did you find particularly helpful about this representation?</li>
                    <li>I am noticing a lot of students selected (this) model. Why do you think so many of us chose that representation?</li>
                    <li>Why didn’t you pick (the most popular)?</li>
                    <li>I am interested in this representation…. (least picked)</li>
                    <li>One of my favourite representations of <abbr title="two fifths">2&frasl;5</abbr> is (show a representation that students did not show <abbr title="For example">e.g.</abbr>, position on a number line). Why do you think I like this type of representation?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Push their thinking for each representation by using some of the following questions:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>So what does the 4 (2) represent?</li>
                    <li>What does the 10 (5) represent?</li>
                    <li>How are the 4 and the 10 (2 and 5) related?</li>
                    <li>Why is it important for this to be partitioned into equal parts?</li>
                    <li>What do equal parts mean in this model?</li>
                    <li>Where do you think this representation (one they did not show) would belong?</li>
