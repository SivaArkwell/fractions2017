Have someone share their answer and then ask students to come to the front of the room to model this thinking. For example, if a student says you need four girls then the teacher asks four girls to come up and stand at the front. Engage the students in further sharing of their reasoning and have students move to/from the front of the room accordingly. Responses will include that there must be:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>four boys (so four boys will move to the front of the room).</li>

              <p>Continue to refer back to the original requirements so that students can see how they are meeting them as they change the composition of the group/set. Once they are done, remind them that this is a set which has been described using a number of fractions.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>a set where one-half your set is at a high height and one-half is low</li>
                <li>a set of facial expressions representing a fraction of your choice (<abbr title="For example">e.g.</abbr>, one-fourth are smiling)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Have pairs join another pair (square). Provide the group with 2 minutes to identify and plan the model of a fraction that they create using levels and/or facial expressions (<abbr title="For example">e.g.</abbr> , high and low with scared and with crying – <abbr title="one fourth"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></abbr> is low and happy). Select a few groups to share their fractions with their classmates.</p>

              <p>Have each square join with another square to form a group of 8. Repeat the activity of planning and modeling a fraction as a group. Ask some groups to model their fraction without identifying the fraction they selected. Have students share what fractions they identify in the model.</p>

              <p>Dear Ms. Fraction,</p>
              <p>In class yesterday Devon created the fraction 3/8 for the shapes we were given. The only way I could see that fraction was by considering the fraction of the shapes that had four sides but Devon said she looked at shapes that have four or more sides and are shaded in. I thought you could only consider one characteristic when creating a fraction, such as shape, and not two, such as shape and colour. Can you help me understand what Devon is thinking?</p>
