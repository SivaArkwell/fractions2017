    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>This is a set of prompts consisting of purposely paired fractions to elicit the use of various strategies. The prompts may be used on different occasions for either Minds-On activities or for Action tasks depending on student readiness. Repeated practice and exploration in making comparisons between fractions will deepen student understanding. Encourage students to build models/representations and create contexts to support visualization of fractions, which in turn supports meaning-making. </p>
  
    <h4>Mathematics</h4>
    <p>Research shows that it is beneficial to spread fraction learning throughout the year and embed it in other strands. These prompts progress in complexity from comparisons of equivalent fractions, to examples that include same denominators, to comparisons of very close fractions with different numerators and denominators. Students are encouraged to develop a range of different strategies and to use them strategically, based on the situation.</p>

        <li>use benchmarks to make estimates for comparison</li>
        <li>consider the size of the unit fractions (as indicated by the denominators)</li>
        <li>consider the proximity of the fraction to 1 by identifying the ‘missing piece’ (complement)</li>
        <li>be purposeful about the strategy for comparison based on the fractions given</li>

              <h2>Equivalency Comparisons (Comp A) Teacher Notes: Anticipating Student Responses </h2>
              
              <p>These prompts can be used flexibly depending on student readiness, for example, as assessment for learning, activating prior knowledge, learning tasks or assessment of learning. These prompts are presented symbolically and without context in order to allow students to build models/representations and create contexts to support visualization of the meaning of the fractions. The prompts are increasingly complex and consist of purposely-paired fractions to elicit the use of various strategies.</p>

            <section>
              <h5><strong>Prompt #1</strong></h5>
              <p>Are <abbr title="Two Sixths"><sup>2</sup>/<sub>6</sub></abbr> and <abbr title="Four Twelfths"><sup>4</sup>/<sub>12</sub></abbr> equal? Show your thinking.</p>
              <p><u>Teacher Notes:</u></p>
              <p>Using a model, students may further partition sixths into twelfths (or merge twelfths to create sixths) to generate equivalent fractions. For a number line, students may explain that two <abbr title="One Sixth"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub></abbr> hops are equivalent to four <abbr title="Two Twelfth"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>12</sub></abbr> hops.</p>
              <figure>

            <section>
              <h5><strong>Prompt #2</strong></h5>
              <p>Show that <abbr title="Three Fourths"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></abbr> is the same as <abbr title="Fifteen Twentieths"><sup>15</sup>/<sub>20</sub></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Students may create representations to prove that these fractions are equal. Students who have been taught the algorithm for determining equivalent fractions by multiplying the numerator and denominator by a number may multiply both the numerator and denominator of <abbr title="Three Fourths"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></abbr> by 5 (which is equivalent to multiplying by one since they are multiplying <abbr title="Three Fourhts"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></abbr> by <abbr title="Five Fifths"><sup>5</sup>/<sub>5</sub></abbr>).</p>
              <p>Using a rectangular model, as in the example below, we can further partition each fourth into fifths to create twentieths. This allows students to understand how the algorithm (multiply by <abbr title="Five Fifths"><sup>5</sup>/<sub>5</sub></abbr>) acts on the <abbr title="Three Fourths"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></abbr>. It also helps to reinforce that the two fractions, although written using different fractional units (denominators), represent the same area (or quantity) and are therefore equivalent.</p>

            <section class="padding-bottom">
              <h5><strong>Prompt #3</strong></h5>
              <p>Is <abbr title="Two Sixths"><sup>2</sup>/<sub>6</sub></abbr> equal to <abbr title="Three ninths"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>9</sub></abbr>? Show your thinking.</p>
              <p><u>Teacher Notes:</u></p>
              <p>This prompt is slightly more difficult than Prompt 2, because students are not told that the fractions are equivalent. As well, there is not an obvious multiplier that will generate the second fraction.</p>
              <p>Students may use stacked number lines to determine equivalence.</p>
