    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Students “count up” using unit fractions (for example, <abbr title="one fourth"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></abbr>, <abbr title="one third"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></abbr>, <abbr title="one half"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></abbr>, <abbr title="one eighth"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">etc</abbr>.). The students or teacher can choose any unit fractions, and the teacher or students can set game rules such as: "When you get to one whole, stand up and state the quantity as both a fraction and as a whole". Note: this game is similar to a well-known number game called BUZZ.</p>

    <h4>Mathematics</h4>
    <p>Unit fractions are the base of all fractions. For example, one fourth is a single one-fourth unit. Two fourths are two one-fourth units. When we count these fourths, we use the language 1 one-fourth, 2 one-fourths, 3 one-fourths, 4 one-fourths, 5 one-fourths and so on. This helps students understand that we are counting units that are fourths and this allows us to count beyond one whole, such as 5 one-fourths.</p>

  <section class="row">
      <h4>Curriculum Connections</h4>
      <p>Students will:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>learn how to count fractions in various ways, developing a sense of magnitude</li>
        <li>count using unit fractions to go beyond one whole (<abbr title="For example">e.g.</abbr>, 15 one-fourths)</li>
        <li>develop the ability to calculate halves and wholes mentally based on unit fractions counting</li>
      </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="row">
      <h4>Instructional sequence</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Start in a circle, and have students count the unit fraction of your (or a student’s) choice. If the fraction selected is <abbr title="one fourth"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></abbr> , for example, the first person in the circle would say “1 one-fourth”; the second person would say “2 one-fourths”; the third person would say “3 one-fourths”, and so on. When a student arrives at a whole number (such as 4 one-fourths), they need to stand up and say the whole number equivalent.(This continues for each whole number, for example, the student that gets 8 one-fourths needs to say “two”.)</li>
        <li>Be sure students count well beyond one (such as counting to 28 one-fourths).</li>
        <li>When all students have counted ask students key questions.</li>
      </ol>
  </section>

  <section class="row">
    <h4>Variations on the game</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Use concrete materials to help count by unit fractions.</li>
      <li>One person states a unit fraction (such as one-fifth). Students move around to join with enough people to represent 1 or 2 or 3 wholes (<abbr title="For example">e.g.</abbr>
      , to make two wholes counting one-fifths, 10 people, each representing one-fifth, would join together).</li>
      <li>Add a second action/word whenever you get to the equivalent of the half-way mark between each whole.</li>
      <li>Have students represent the fraction using a model of choice when a random buzzer sounds.</li>
    </ol>

      <h4>Highlights of student thinking</h4>
      <p>Students may:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>connect counting unit fractions to counting other units, such as units of measure or items</li>
        <li>find the concept of the unit fraction challenging at first</li>
        <li>get ‘stuck’ when counting beyond the whole</li>
        <li>come up with a wide range of variations to the game when invited to do so.
        Note: Field testing of this game demonstrated that it aided students in distinguishing between unit fractions (<abbr title="For example">e.g.</abbr>, 5 one-fourths) and mixed fractions (<abbr title="For example">e.g.</abbr>, 1 and one-fourth). Further, it supported student understanding of what made up a whole (in both area and set models)</li>

      <h4>Key questions</h4>
      <ol>
      <li>If each person counted one-fourth in our count, how many one-fourths would we have counted in total? (<abbr title="For example">e.g.</abbr>
      , if there are 27 students, they will have counted 27 one-fourths, or 6 wholes and three-fourths).</li>
      <li>How many wholes did we count? Did we end on a whole?</li>
      <li>How many one-fourth units did it take to make one? How do you know?</li>
      </ol>
