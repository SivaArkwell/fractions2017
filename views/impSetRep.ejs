                <p>Show students 2 red and 1 blue counters equal in size. Ask why this could represent <abbr title="two thirds"><sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub></abbr> (There are 3 things altogether and 2 are red, which is ‘part-whole’ relationship.)</p>
                <p>Show 1 red and 1 blue counter and 1 red linking cube, all separated. Ask if this still shows <abbr title="two thirds"><sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub></abbr>. Ask why? (There are still 3 things and 2 are red. In this set, we are looking at the colours.) Ask what the numerator 2 tells. (how many parts we’re using/referring to when we say “red”. Note that the numerator would have been 1 had we said “blue” instead of “red”) Ask what the denominator 3 tells? (how many things there are altogether in the set.). Ask what <abbr title="three thirds"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub></abbr> would mean? (all 3 parts of a set of 3, or the whole set of 3). Ask what <abbr title="four thirds"><sup>4</sup>/<sub>3</sub></abbr> would mean? (1 more part than the whole set of 3). Show 4 counters in a bag and one counter outside the bag. Ask students what fractions they see in this model. (<abbr title="For example">e.g.</abbr>
                , <abbr title="five fourths"><sup>5</sup>/<sub>4</sub></abbr> because there are 5 counters but it only takes 4 to fill one whole bag; <abbr title="four fifths"><sup>4</sup>/<sub>5</sub></abbr> because 4 of the set are in the bag but there are 5 counters total.) Bring “whole” into the discussion and tell students that they must identify the whole when writing a fraction. Engage them in reasoning that when we are working with bags of cookies we would call the whole the entire set of cookies in one bag.</p>

                    <li>Explain why you chose this representation.</li>

                    <li>Is this a reasonable answer, given that…?</li>
                    <li>How do these different representations connect to one another?</li>

                <p>Ask specific students with correct representations to show one of the fractions in a way that allows all students to see all of the fractions represented during the following discussion. Gather and discuss with the class, ways in which the given fractions are alike (all the fractions are improper; the numerator is greater than the denominator; each fraction is more than 3 and less than 4, there are always 4 items left when items are rearranged into the bags), and ways that they are different (the sizes of the numbers; whether the denominators and numerators are even or odd; the number of parts in a whole, etc).</p>
                
                <p>If necessary, ask questions such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How did you know you needed to draw more than 3 whole bags?</li>
                    <li>What is another fraction that would be like all of these?</li>
                    <li>What is a fraction that would be different from all of these?</li>
                    <li>Why does it make sense to call these fractions even though they are more than a whole? (<abbr title="For example">e.g.</abbr>
                , because they are written like fractions and they are just counting parts of wholes.)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>If some students need a challenge, add an example with equivalent mixed numbers <abbr title="For example">e.g.</abbr>
                , <abbr title="seven halves"><sup>7</sup>/<sub>2</sub></abbr> and <abbr title="twenty-one sixths"><sup>21</sup>/<sub>6</sub></abbr>;</p>
                <p>As students share their responses, highlight the terminology of improper fraction and mixed number. Also, reinforce that the numerator can be larger than the denominator.</p>
