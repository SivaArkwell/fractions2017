      <h3>Background</h3>
      
      <p>Comparing and ordering fractions allows students to develop a sense of fraction as quantity, as well as a sense of the size of a fraction, both necessary prior knowledge components for understanding fraction operations (Johanning, 2011).</p>
      
      <p>Comparing and ordering fractions with different fractional units (or denominators) leads students to identify the need for equivalent fractions. When students determine an equivalent fraction they are changing the unit of measure by either splitting or merging the partitions of the original fraction. The following illustration demonstrates these concepts using an area model:</p>

      <p>The exploration of equivalence allows students to develop an understanding of equivalent fractions as simply being a different way of naming the same quantity; it also supports them in viewing the fraction as a numeric value. A solid understanding of equivalence helps students with fractions operations, especially addition and subtraction.</p>

                <p>Students will change the fractional amounts in a recipe into multiples of the unit fraction, <abbr title="One Quarter"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>​</abbr>, in order to accurately mix ingredients using only a <abbr title="One Quarter"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>​</abbr> measuring cup. They will be composing equivalent fractions using unit fractions and representing them in a variety of ways. As an option, the recipe can be prepared and baked by the class.</p>

                <p>This is a set of prompts consisting of purposely paired fractions to elicit the use of various strategies. The prompts may be used on different occasions for either Minds-On activities or for Action tasks depending on student readiness. Repeated practice and exploration in making comparisons between fractions will deepen student understanding. Encourage students to build models/representations and create contexts to support visualization of fractions, which in turn supports meaning-making. </p>
